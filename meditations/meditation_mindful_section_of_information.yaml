      As you settle in comfortably, remind yourself of the importance of
      mindful selectivity. Every piece of information, every thought that you 
      let into your mind shapes your world.

      Now, visualize a gatekeeper at the entrance of your mind. It's your
      conscious choice. This gatekeeper only allows in thoughts that are
      positive, creative, and inspiring. Let this be your practice for the
      next few moments.

      Picture the gatekeeper gently sending away any negative thoughts or
      gossip that arrive. As these thoughts approach, they are kindly but
      firmly turned away. They have no place in the serene garden of your mind.

      Allow your gatekeeper to warmly welcome thoughts and ideas that you
      find interesting. These thoughts make your mind richer, add colour to
      your inner world. Embrace them.

      into your daily life. The careful selection of what you let into your
      mind is not a one-time act, but a continuous process. You have the power
      to shape your world with your healthy mind.
