          Begin by taking a moment to find a comfortable position. This could be sitting, standing, or lying down 
          whatever feels right for you. Close your eyes, and bring your attention to your breath. Let it flow naturally, 
          not trying to change it, just noticing how it moves in and out of your body. Feel the rhythm of your breath 
          and let it anchor you in this moment.

          Gradually move your attention to your body, starting at your toes and moving upwards. 
          Notice any sensations you might be feeling â€“ perhaps warmth, cold, tightness, or relaxation. As you observe these feelings, 
          remind yourself that there's no need to judge or change anything. You're simply exploring what is present right now.

          Begin to imagine curiosity as a warm, welcoming light. Visualize it starting small, 
          like a tiny spark within you. With each breath, let this spark of curiosity grow. 
          See it as a warm, gentle light expanding within you, filling every part of your body.

          As you sit in this radiant glow of curiosity, allow your mind to open up to the universe around you. 
          What are you curious about? What questions arise within you? Remember, 
          this is a space of non-judgment. There are no silly or unimportant questions here.
          Let them surface freely, and acknowledge each one as it arises.

          For the last minute, hold all your questions and curiosity within you, feeling the energy they bring. 
          Remember, you don't need to find answers now. Instead, appreciate the questions themselves, 
          and the curiosity that brought them to light. Hold onto this feeling of curiosity; 
          it's a powerful tool for discovery, learning, and personal growth.
