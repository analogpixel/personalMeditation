        As we begin this meditation, find a
        comfortable seated position. Take a deep breath in, then let it out.
        Allow your mind to settle into the present moment. Recognize any feelings
        of procrastination that may be lingering, but don't judge them. Simply
        acknowledge their presence and allow them to be.

        Now, visualize your
        creative project in your mind. See it completed, in all its intricate
        details. Experience the joy, satisfaction, and sense of accomplishment
        that comes with its completion. Use this image as a beacon guiding your
        energy and effort.

        As you breathe in,
        imagine a warm, invigorating energy entering your body. This energy is
        imbued with the power to dissolve procrastination. As you breathe out,
        release any resistance, lethargy, or hesitation.

        you, replacing any self-doubt with confidence.
