      As we begin this meditation, find a comfortable position. Close your eyes and 
      allow your body to start to relax. Inhale deeply, hold for a moment, and 
      exhale completely. Release any tension you may be holding.

      Begin to let your mind quiet. Imagine your thoughts as leaves floating on a 
      stream, simply observing them as they pass without attachment. As your mind 
      becomes more silent, your body will respond with deeper relaxation.

      Now, focus on the sensation of relaxation spreading through your body. From 
      your toes to your head, every muscle is releasing its hold. Your body is heavy 
      and sinking into the support beneath you.

      You are now entering an alpha state, a state of calm alertness. This state is 
      often associated with creativity and reduced stress. Here, your mind is 
      receptive and open. Imagine you are on the edge of sleep, but still conscious 
      and aware.

      As we approach the final minute of this guided segment, begin to transition 
      into a theta state. This is the state of deep relaxation and meditation, where 
      learning, intuition, and memory are heightened. Continue to breathe and relax 
      deeply.

      You are now in a theta state. Continue to maintain this deep level of 
      relaxation and meditation for the next 25 minutes. Let your consciousness 
      float in this space, peaceful and serene.
